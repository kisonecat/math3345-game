# Math 3345H, version 1.0.0.

## By Jim Fowler

# What is this game?

Math 3345H at Ohio State is the "Foundations of Higher Mathematics"
course, and as such, it serves as an introduction to proof.  The
course is focused on writing, but I suspect formal proofs (like those
you can explore via this system) may provide additional insight.
